# Unit Testing
like how chefs test food, programmers have to test their classes
A **Testbench** is a program that _thoroughly_ tests another program (or part of it)
- uses a series of input/output checks, called **Unit Tests**
**Unit Testing** means to create and run a testbench on a specific item, classes or methods

**Regression Testing** is keeping up with the TestBench to make sure previosly functioning methods continue to work
If a passing method fails after changes, it has _Regressed_

If a test fails, check the testbench code before changing the actual code
- wrong expected values
- test object's data not properly set

Then we did some example unit testing
